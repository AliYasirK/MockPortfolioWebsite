            <p>Harry potter has been my favorite book and movie series since I was a child. I have awed over this amazing series created by J. K. Rowling most of my life, and I honestly don't know any other book series I would enjoy if Harry Potter didn't exist</p><br>

                When I was around 10-11 years old, my parents used to take my and my siblings to the North Kansas City public library to pick out 1 book for the week. Of courseas children, we didn't want to read, but watch movies, so we would sneak out a movie or two and watch it when our parents werent home.
                One week, we picked out a Harry Potter movie, ofcourse we didn't know what it was, but once we watched it, we instantly loved it. When we returned to the library,
                I found out that the movie I loved so much was a book series, so I began reading. My siblings quickly grew out of Harry POtter, but I continued to love this
                amazing series.
